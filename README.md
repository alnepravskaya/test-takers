The Exercise<br>
The goal of the exercise is to create a list of test-takers (test-takers can be seen as
users).<br>
The homework has to be done in JavaScript (no TypeScript or other languages)<br>
Create a component that enables you to load the data from the API and display the
names of the test takers. Here is the link of the API: http://hr.oat.taocloud.org/api/ <br>
 The component should contain one row per test takers, the number of rows can
eventually be limited.<br>
 The rows can be sorted<br>
 The component let’s the user see the test taker details<br>
 The source code must be written in plain JavaScript, CSS and HTML only. No library
nor framework is allowed however you can use any tooling library. For example, you
can’t use Angular, React or jQuery but you can use webpack, browserify, eslint.<br>
 The component should work on the last versions Firefox, Chrome and Safari
(including for mobile).
